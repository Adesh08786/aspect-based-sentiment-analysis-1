      "I wonder if thats just Apples way of saying its time to get the newest and greatest laptop 3-4 years from now lol.\n",

      "Two times with in one month.\n",
      "I am not one to throw things like this around but it is a laptop so carrying it around does seem to mean it will be jerked possibly a little, while driving a car and carrying it into where ever you are using it.\n",

      "I was psyched.\n",
      "I thought all my problems would finally be solved being that my old computer would not go onto our wireless network and I would not have the same problems because it was updated.\n",
      "Here we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing.\n",

      "Because we did not purchase the extended warranty in time, we are on the hook for the repair.\n",
      "The Genius at the Apple store advised me that there was nothing about my use of the computer that caused this failure.\n",
      "In fact, he said, about 10% of their products fail.\n",
      "Hmmm - that high failure rate sure is not reflected in the retail price.\n",

      "it has / it is also very capable of doing moderate video editing (although you may need the performance boost of the larger MacBook Pros for heavy duty mobile video editing).\n",
      "The operating system and user interface is very intuitive, and the large multi-touch track pad is amazing.\n",
      "Typically, when I purchase a new laptop I always end up using an external mouse for convenience.\n",
      "However, the multi-touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary (unless you are gaming).\n",
      "Still, this laptop is perfect for all day use at school and work.\n",

      "dell is a decently made pc.\n",
      "although its windows vista compared to windows xp sucks.\n",
      "the graphics are awful and the wireless switch it at the top rather than the side which I am used to it being on the side.\n",
      "with the switch being at the top you need to memorize the key combination rather than just flicking a switch.\n",
      "so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro 1000 to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop.\n",

      "The battery life is good, even with using high profile software like Sibelius 7 for a good half of the day.\n",
      "Overall, the performance and specs are definitely great for the price compared to other laptop of the same price, which make this Apple purchase a worthwhile one.\n",
      "This a starter notebook.\n",
      "The processor a AMD Semprom at 2.1 ghz is a bummer it does not have the power for HD or heavy computing.\n",
      "The notebook is lacking a HDMI port and a S-video port that would enable one to hook it to a TV.\n",
      "If you check you will find the same notebook with the above missing ports and a dual core AMD or Intel processor.\n",

      "Anyways I bought this two months ago and when I first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the hard drive and it is putting it temporaly in save zone.\n",
      "So I called customer support (which is good too) and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all, I just chose to hide the message.\n",
      "I have had the netbook for 2 months and I love it, I read some reviews that say netbooks are slow but it does not seem any slower than the other computers I use.\n",
      "Also the speakers are not very loud, But it is a netbook.\n",
      "Would HIGHLY recommend this netbook though.\n",
      "Ok, this is probably the best laptop series ever devised by Apple.\n",
      "The case is carved out of a single block of aluminum.\n",
      "Although I opted for the lowest end MacBook Pro, this thing holds its own.\n",
      "The processor screams, and because of the unique way that Apple OSX 16 functions, most of the graphics are routed through the hardware rather than the software.\n",
      "That is how it is able to function better than any other PC.\n",
      "I have recommended this laptop to everyone I know who is buying one.\n",
      "I like it so much, I bought another just for my wife.\n",
      "I just bought this computer from the Apple Store, and I could not be more impressed with it.\n",
      "It has a stunning retina display, and is very fast.\n",
      "The solid-state memory makes it a lot faster than previous MacBook Pro models that used a spinning hard drive.\n",
      "This computer is good for anything, and it has really superseded my high expectations.\n",
      "Also, the sound quality from the speakers is crystal clear, and everything is just sleek and smooth.\n",
      "The HD display is sensational, and now watching any movie is a very enjoyable experience for me.\n",
      "No hardware issues, as is common with any Apple product.\n",
      "Great product, and could not be happier with it.\n",
      "Meh...but cheap.\n",
      "I bought this so that I could sit on the couch and surf internet with a larger screen than iPad was offering.\n",
      "The reviews at the time in late July 2014 were mostly positive and it was the best selling laptop with almost 4 star review...\n",
      "The first thing I can say for positive is that the laptop is very light- makes it really portable..this with a relatively clear screen is a bonus.\n",
      "Now the graphics are not HD...and the reason that it is light is that it is really basic (medium low grade) plastic.\n",
      "So if you do not have kids, or not in high school or do not accidently sit on it, it should be fine.\n",
      "Now the speed is disappointing.\n",
      "Start up is fine  maybe 20 secs at most, but then to get pages to load on internet is molasses at times.\n",
      "Even for a 4GB RAM it barely chugs with 3 tabs open.\n",
      "I tried all the Window updates (this worked for a couple of HP laptops I7in that I bought later at BB) to see if it could remove the drag, it did not.\n",
      "Really at this point I am trying to confirm if the RAM can be upgraded to see if I can do that to help.\n",
      "Couple that with lack of inbuilt Bluetooth, dvd drive you are looking at a close tie (or even a loss) compared with the other laptops on sale in mid to late August 2014.\n",
      "The HP laptops 17in (with i3 core and AMD) I mentioned before from the other big electronic BB store smoked this one even before I updated windows and upped the RAM.\n",
      "But alas they were gifts...and what is a gift if not given?\n",
      "All in all I wish I had waited a bit.\n",
      "But then again hindsight is 20/20.\n",
      "Bought a usb dvd rW drive but have not used it yet.\n",
      "Let me start with the good:So awesome.\n",
      "Great OS, fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the processor speed and adding the thunderbolt port.\n",
      "This is my second MacBook.\n",
      "The first one I had was a 2006 model, not the Pro.\n",
      "I fell in love with it.\n",
      "This one has had the same effect.\n",
      "I had upgraded my old MacBook to Lion, so I kind of knew what I was getting, but had not been able to enjoy some of the awesome new multi-touch features.\n",
      "The improvements to the OS have been relatively gradual, but substantive.\n",
      "The feel of this machine compared to the old MacBook is far superior.\n",
      "The Unibody construction is solid, sleek and beautiful.\n",
      "It is everything I had / I would hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint, but somehow a bit more sturdy.\n",
      "For the not so good, I got the stock screen - which is VERY glossy.\n",
      "it has / it is still beautiful and has better color reproduction than I could ever expect from a notebook.\n",
      "The reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlled-lighting environment like me (I prefer it dark) or if you can crank up the brightness.\n",
      "My real problem with it?\n",
      "The statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration -- it has / it is a lie.\n",
      "I challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than 2.5 hrs out of it.\n",
      "The first full charge of this battery got me only about 2 full hours.\n",
      "Enabling the battery timer is useless.\n",
      "The \"Time remaining\" goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes.\n",
      "it has / it is a joke.\n",
      "it has / it is so bad that I am thinking I only got half a battery or something.\n",
      "I know what 7 hrs of battery looks like.\n",
      "This am not / are not it.\n",
      "My only other complaint is that it gets really hot.:-)\n",
      "If you buy this - do not go into it expecting 7 hrs of battery life, and you shall / you will be perfectly satisfied.\n",
      "I previously owned an HP desktop and a Dell laptop.\n",
      "Both computers started acting extremely slow within the first year of owning them.\n",
      "I have never had any issues or problems with my MacBook Pro so far, and it is still as fast as it was when I first bought it.\n",
      "I especially like the backlit keyboard.\n",
      "It makes doing schoolwork at night so much easier.\n",
      "It is also very lightweight, making transporting this computer very easy.\n",
      "The graphics on this computer are also stellar - very clear and vivid.\n",
      "The applications are also very easy to find and maneuver, much easier than any other computer I have ever owned.\n",
      "I use iphoto all the time, which is a great program for anyone who is into photography - amateurs and experts alike.\n",
      "The program came with the computer and works beautifully.\n",
      "I definitely will buy a Mac again if and when this computer ever fails.\n",
      "I have had my Macbook Pro since August 2009.\n",
      "Prior to this computer, I owned a PowerBook G4 for 6 years (quite a long time for a laptop).\n",
      "That was my first Apple product and since then I have been incredibly happy with every product of theirs I have bought.\n",
      "My MacBook Pro is no exception.\n",
      "On my PowerBook G4 I would never use the trackpad I would use an external mouse because I did not like the trackpad.\n",
      "Since I have had this computer I have only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth.\n",
      "I also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad.\n",
      "The display is incredibly bright, much brighter than my PowerBook and very crisp.\n",
      "The computer runs very fast with no problems and the iLife software that comes with it (iPhoto, iMovie, iWeb, iTunes, GarageBand) is all very helpful as well.\n",
      "I also purchased iWork to go with it which has programs for word processing, spreadsheets, and presentations (similar to Microsoft Office).\n",
      "I like those programs better than Office and you can save your files to be completely compatible with the Office programs as well.\n",
      "I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get a new laptop who is willing to spend a little more money to get great quality!\n",
      "Great laptop from Apple!\n",
      "Apple is unrivaled in terms of build quality and functionality.\n",
      "The retina screen is absolutely beautiful and the touchpad is the best touchpad to date.\n",
      "The pair allow for seamless navigation throughout the whole interface.\n",
      "Battery life is astonishing given the processing power and high resolution display.\n",
      "I can easily get 10 hours out of a full charge.\n",
      "Also, I find OS X much more simple and easy to use than Windows.\n",
      "Overall, a high quality laptop and a great value considering all this computer has to offer.\n",
      "I get a ton of compliments on its size, and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus, I can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you are restricted to the width of your body for computing room.\n",
      "Very long-life battery (up to 10-11 hours depending on how you configure power level settings).\n",
      "I upgraded the memory and replaced the base Windows 7 Starter to Win 7 Home, and it runs just fine.\n",
      "I play a lot of casual games online, and the touchpad is very responsive.\n",
      "The only thing I wish this had was the option to turn off the touchpad with a button like my big 16\" laptop does.\n",
      "I would not play a first-person shooter with this, mind, but if you wanted to run MS Office, email, chat, download a video, listen to music from a certain fruit-named music store, and were looking for a highly portable yet powerful netbook to do that all in, I had / I would highly recommend checking this out.\n",
      "The downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook: screen size is not something I had / I would stare at for the entire 10-11 hours of battery life five days a week.\n",
      "Additional caveat: the base installation comes with some Toshiba-specific software that may or may not be to a user's liking.\n",
      "The Macbook is a fantastic laptop.\n",
      "This is the first macbook I have ever had.\n",
      "I came from the Dell Laptops and now I am so glad I switched when I needed a new laptop.\n",
      "The macbooks are small enough to be very portable yet hold tons of information and performance.\n",
      "Although the price is higher then Dell laptops, the Macbooks are worth the dough.\n",
      "You will love this macbook if you choose to buy it.\n",
      "The macbook rarely requires a hard reboot.\n",
      "It just works flawlessly!\n",
      "Its hard to encounter a problem on a mac that would require such abrupt action.\n",
      "Dells are ok, HPs are not / am not that good, but Macs or Fantastic.\n",
      "I honestly love my mac, thats why I am a self proclaimed mac addict.\n",
      "If you want more information on macs I suggest going to apple.com and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications.\n",
      "I am glad I made the choice to switch and buy this MAC.\n",
      "The benefits were immediate!\n",
      "Awesome graphics!\n",
      "Applications respond immediately (not like the tired MS applications).\n",
      "I can actually get work done with this MAC, and not fight with it like my tired old PC laptop.\n",
      "The magnetic plug-in power charging power cord is great (I even put it to the test by accident)- excellent innovation!\n",
      "The Apple applications (ex.iPhoto) are fun, easy, and really cool to use (unlike the competition)!\n",
      "After doing CAD work all day at work, using a higher end PC, I could not come home and settle for the use of a lower end computer.\n",
      "This laptop rocks (only wish it could run SolidWorks CAD - which Apple does not support)!\n",
      "I have saved a lot of time and headaches so far, using my new MacBook Pro.\n",
      "I am definitely sold, and not going back to PCs for home use!\n",
      "I have had this laptop for about a month now.\n",
      "It has served my needs quite nicely for the most part.\n",
      "The 2 GB of RAM is plenty, able to run Windows 7 and at least 2 or 3 other programs with next to no slowdown.\n",
      "The ATI graphics card is a huge plus, definitely a good value if you need to be able to run some slightly older games that a Intel built-in card would have trouble with, such as Half-Life 2 or even World of Warcraft.\n",
      "My one complaint with this laptop is that I have noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in.\n",
      "This is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components, and I am hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator, but I still expected better product quality for this price range.\n",
      "Other than that, I would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi-decent gaming capabilities.\n",
      "My MacBook is probably the best investment I have ever made.\n",
      "I have had it for almost four years now and I have only had a few problems with it.\n",
      "The most recent being that my Safari internet browser is freaking out on me, but I have just been using firefox instead.\n",
      "If you had PC for four years I can almost gaurentee that something would of gone wrong by now, maybe even forcing you to replace your entire computer.\n",
      "I love this computer.\n",
      "Its small enough where I can take it pretty much anywhere, but still has a big enough screen to get everything done.\n",
      "Everything is so easy to use, Mac software is just so much simpler than Microsoft software.\n",
      "The only thing that I do not like about my mac is that sometimes there are programs that I want to be able to run and I am not able to.\n",
      "Games being the main issue.\n",
      "It drives me crazy when I want to download a game or something of that nature and I cannot play it because its not compatable with the software.\n"
